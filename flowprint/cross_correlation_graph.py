        Attributes
        ----------
        window : float
            Threshold for the window size in seconds

        correlation : float
            Threshold for the minimum required correlation

        graph : nx.Graph
            Cross correlation graph containing all correlations
            Note that each node in the graph represents an 'activity signature'
            to avoid duplicates. The NetworkDestinations corresponding to each
            signature are stored in the 'mapping' attribute.

            Note
            ----
            IMPORTANT: The CrossCorrelation.graph object is an optimised graph.
            Each node does not represent a network destination, but represents
            an activity fingerprint. E.g. when destinations A and B are both
            only active at time slices 3 and 7, then these destinations are
            represented by a single node. We use the self.mapping to extract the
            network destinations from each graph node.
            This is a huge optimisation for finding cliques as the number of
            different network destinations theoretically covers the entire IP
            space, whereas the number of activity fingerprints is bounded by
            2^(batch / window), in our work 2^(300/30) = 2^10 = 1024. If these
            parameters change, the complexity may increase, but never beyond the
            original bounds. Hence, this optimisation never has a worse time
            complexity.
